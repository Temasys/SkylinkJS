# SKYLINK WEB SDK DEMOS
- To get started, you will require an API Key to begin.
- To register for an API Key, simply sign up for a developer account at our [Developer Console](https://console.temasys.io).
- All demos are located in this [directory](https://github.com/Temasys/SkylinkJS/tree/2.x.x/master/demos/collection)

## How to run the demos
Using [Git](http://git-scm.com/download) command line tools, execute the following:
```
# 1. Clone or download this repository via git terminal.

git clone https://github.com/Temasys/SkylinkJS.git

# 2. Install all required dependencies. Use (sudo npm install) if required.

npm install

# 3. Once you received your API key, navigate to /demos/collection and create a config.js file (take example on config-example.js) and fill it with your information.

# 4. Run the start script to start a local webserver to access the demo and doc folders. This will popup Chrome (Mac). You can configure a different browser in the start.sh file. Alternatively, you can run (sh start.sh)

npm start # Note that this runs in Chrome currently.
```
