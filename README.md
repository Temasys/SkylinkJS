# ![SkylinkJS](http://temasys.github.io/resources/img/skylinkjs.svg)

> SkylinkJS is an open-source client-side library for your web-browser that enables any website to easily leverage the capabilities of WebRTC and its direct data streaming powers between peers for audio/video conferencing or file transfer.

We've gone to great length to make this library work in as many browsers as possible. SkylinkJS is build on top of [AdapterJS](http://github.com/Temasys/AdapterJS) and works with our [Temasys WebRTC Plugin](https://temasys.atlassian.net/wiki/display/TWPP/WebRTC+Plugins) even in Internet Explorer and Safari on Mac and PC.

You'll need a Temasys Developer Account and an API key to use this. [Register here to get your API key](https://developer.temasys.com.sg).
